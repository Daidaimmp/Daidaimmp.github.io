### Abstract
This paper introduces Ladderpath, an efficient algorithm designed to reveal nested hierarchical structures within sequences. It has significant applications in analyzing natural language texts and biological sequences.

### Key Contributions
* Proposed a novel algorithmic framework for sequence hierarchy.
* Demonstrated efficiency improvements over existing methods.
* Validated on multiple real-world datasets including genomic data.
